Introduction:
The goal for this assignment is to build a basic app to create, edit, read, and delete clinical encounter notes that will be stored in a simple text file. As such, in this assignment you will be practicing:

Some object-oriented design and defining classes in a separate class library
File I/O
More Win Forms UI interactions and application state management
And Regexes to extract vitals (e.g. Heart rate (HR), Blood Pressure (BP), etc. readings from free text clinical notes.
I have posted a video (in the assignment folder) demonstrating a working solution but also the following screenshot provides you with a sample UI
